Explain the importance and usage of the below terms in details

 DFSInputStream:
  -The input in the HDFS will be read using this class.
  -Integrity is handled.
  -And it helps in communication between name node and datanodes (each namenode will communicate with many data node).
  -If there is any failure in datanode then it manages teh read process.
  -DFSInputStream will manage the nodes of FSDataInputStream.
                  
DFSOutputStream:
  -It will also perform various process similar to  DFSInputStream.
  -With the help of DFSOutputStream node management happens between datanode and namenode.
  -Each data will be broken into numerous packets and and during the writing process it will be in the internam queue called as data queue
also it maintains the  internal queue called ack queue.

FSDataInputStream:
  -There will be a stream channel for reading of data.
  -The data to be read will be provided by the client from FSDataInputStream.
  -And the read will be called form the read().
  -After the reading process gets over it will call close().

FSDataOutputStream:
  -And there will be Stream channel for data witing.
  -And for the client to write the FSDataOutputStream will be returned from the Distributed File System.
  -DFSoutputStream will be used by the FSdataOutputStream for datanode nad namenode communication.
  -And signal write() will be passed to write data from the client side.
  -after the data is written will pass close() signal to end the process.
